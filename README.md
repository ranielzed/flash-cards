# Flash Cards
This is a simple flash cards app to help you learn Mandarin. It is built using the [PWA Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-starter-kit), using the default template as the starting point and the [wiki](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/pwa-starter-kit/wiki) for configuring and personalizing.

Apart from several game options, `flash-cards` also comes with a stats page that shows you a heatmap of your answers.


## Features/highlights
- uses Redux to handle the application's state
- this state is also stored and loaded from `localStorage`, so that the last question asked and the stats are persisted across refreshes
- uses the [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) to read out the question being asked
- the actual cards data is loaded from arbitrary `json` files, so the app can be extended to work for any language and any set of words being learnt

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ranielzed/flash-cards
cd flash-cards
npm install
npm start
```

To run the tests, you can run `npm run test`.

## Build and deploy

To build the app, run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder that has all the minified 
bundles and assets you need to deploy. If you want to test that the build output works, you can run

```
npm run serve
```

For deployment, I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s 
pretty much out-of-the-box setup. These are my deploy settings (so that the app is rebuilt and
the bundled app is redeployed every time there's a new commit to master):

Since this app is structured as an `app-shell` (the `index.html` knows how to display the correct route based on the URL, but each URL does not correspond to a standalone view you can just load), I've also added a [`_redirects file`](https://github.com/notwaldorf/flash-cards/blob/master/_redirects) used by the Netlify server tohandle these redirects (read more about that [here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/#history-pushstate-and-single-page-apps))
